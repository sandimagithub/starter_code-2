    <img src="http://lorempixel.com/100/100/cats/8/"/>
    <strong>I am bold!</strong>
    <em>I'm italic!</em>
    <a href="">I'm a link</a>
    <small>I'm small</small>

    <h3>Answer: ______</h3>

    <h2>Make your own!</h2>
    <p>Use the following descriptions to come up with new styles.</p>
    1) <span>This text is red with a strike through it. Did I do something wrong?</span>
    2) <span>It's helpful to style technical term like <span>tag</span> and <span>property</span> with a typewriter font, so they stand out.</span>
    3) <span>You make me wanna <span>shout</span>! (in all caps)</span>
    4) <span>I'm twice as big as everyone else!</span>
    5) <span>I'm twice as small...</span>

    <h2>Create your own</h2>
    <p>It's time to move out of the console and into your stylesheet.  How are we going to differentiate one style from another!? How are we going to apply them to multiple elements?</p>

    vocab
